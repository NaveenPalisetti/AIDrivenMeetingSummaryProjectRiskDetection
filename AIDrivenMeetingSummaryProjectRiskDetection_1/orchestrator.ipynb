1. review of critical bugs found in the validation environment. 2. troubleshooting the trigger loop issue in emxroute_mxjpo. sarah po good morning everyone. weve hit a bit of a snag. priya and mark have logged several blocker issues in the last 24 hours following the codedrop. specifically, the system is hanging when we try to promote a route to the in process state. vikram, i suspect the new jpo triggers are at the heart of this. priya qe it is more than just a hang, sarah. when i try to approve a test route, the application server memory spikes to 95 and then the session times out. ive captured the stack trace, and it looks the emxroute trigger is firing recursively. vikram senior dev right, let me think. if the amodify trigger on the route node is firing, and that trigger updates an attribute on the route, and we have a amodify trigger on the route that in turn looks back at the route node... weve created a classic infinite loop. anjali dev going back to vikram is point, i saw this in the ui logs too. the widget is sending a single update request, but the database is returning a 504 gateway timeout. its definitely a serverside deadlock. david ba this is exactly why i was worried about the custom schema and the complex triggers. if we had stayed ootb, we would not be debugging recursive loops right now. can we just disable the sync trigger for now? vikram senior dev if we disable the sync trigger, david, the inbox tasks will not show the security level, which we agreed was a critical requirement for the medical leads. the issue is not the requirement its the lack of a recursion guard in the jpo code. mark senior qe i ran a quick mql trace on the background process. it is not just one loop it is multiple. for every task in the route, the trigger is firing again. on a route with 50 tasks, thats hundreds of database hits in a single transaction. priya qe and it is breaking the audit trail too. because the transaction never completes, the history records are being rolled back. if an auditor saw this, they would flag it as a data integrity failure. sarah po vikram, how long to implement a recursion guard in emxroute_mxjpo? vikram senior dev i need to implement a global context check. basically, a static variable that flags trigger is already running subsequent calls in the same thread are ignored. itll take about four hours to code and unit test. anjali dev while vikram does that, i need to fix the ui error handling. right now, the widget just spins forever. i should add a timeout notification the user knows the server is struggling. mark senior qe we also need to look at the notemp query vikram. even before the loop starts, the initial query to find all associated tasks is taking 2 seconds. we might need an index on the arel id in the route node table. vikram senior dev i agree on the index, mark. but we have to be careful adding too many indexes slows down the create operations. david ba we are adding a custom attribute, a custom trigger, a recursion guard, and now a custom index? the csv team is going to have a field day with this. sarah po david, we do not have a choice. we are committed to this architecture. vikram, is there any way to make the trigger asynchronous? vikram senior dev not for the security level. if the auditor sees a low security level on a task that should be high even for five seconds, it is a compliance gap. it has to be synchronous. mark senior qe what about the notification? that definitely does not need to be in the same transaction. vikram senior dev true. i can move the 3dnotification call to a background job thread. that will shave off at least 500ms from the main transaction. anjali dev that would help the ui feel much snappier. users hate waiting for the success toast message. priya qe ill need a new build by 4 pm today to reverify the audit logs. if the recursion guard works, the history records should finally show up correctly. sarah po right, im calling it. to summarize vikram is implementing a recursion guard in the jpo and moving notifications to a background process to break the deadlock. anjali is updating the widget error handling for better user feedback. mark is looking into the specific mql index requirements to optimize the relationship queries. the story remains at 8 points, but these bugs are now our top priority for the next 24 hours. vikram, get that fix to mark as soon as the unit tests pass. meeting adjourned.'] selected_action_items=None\n","[DEBUG] Received query: summarize the 6th event with Mistral\n","[DEBUG] Selected event indices:

show the security level, which we agreed was a critical requirement for the medical leads. the issue is not the requirement its the lack of a recursion guard in the jpo code. mark senior qe i ran a quick mql trace on the background process. it is not just one loop it is multiple. for every task in the route, the trigger is firing again. on a route with 50 tasks, thats hundreds of database hits in a single transaction. priya qe and it is breaking the audit trail too. because the transaction never completes, the history records are being rolled back. if an auditor saw this, they would flag it as a data integrity failure. sarah po vikram, how long to implement a recursion guard in emxroute_mxjpo? vikram senior dev i need to implement a global context check. basically, a static variable that flags trigger is already running subsequent calls in the same thread are ignored. itll take about four hours to code and unit test. anjali dev while vikram does that, i need to fix the ui error handling. right now, the widget just spins forever. i should add a timeout notification the user knows the server is struggling. mark senior qe we also need to look at the notemp query vikram. even before the loop starts, the initial query to find all associated tasks is taking 2 seconds. we might need an index on the arel id in the route node table. vikram senior dev i agree on the index, mark. but we have to be careful adding too many indexes slows down the create operations. david ba we are adding a custom attribute, a custom trigger, a recursion guard, and now a custom index? the csv team is going to have a field day with this. sarah po david, we do not have a choice. we are committed to this architecture. vikram, is there any way to make the trigger asynchronous? vikram senior dev not for the security level. if the auditor sees a low security level on a task that should be high even for five seconds, it is a compliance gap. it has to be synchronous. mark senior qe what about the notification? that definitely does not need to be in the same transaction. vikram senior dev true. i can move the 3dnotification call to a background job thread. that will shave off at least 500ms from the main transaction. anjali dev that would help the ui feel much snappier. users hate waiting for the success toast message. priya qe ill need a new build by 4 pm today to reverify the audit logs. if the recursion guard works, the history records should finally show up correctly. sarah po right, im calling it. to summarize vikram is implementing a recursion guard in the jpo and moving notifications to a background process to break the deadlock. anjali is updating the widget error handling for better user feedback. mark is looking into the specific mql index requirements to optimize the relationship queries. the story remains at 8 points, but these bugs are now our top priority for the next 24 hours. vikram, get that fix to mark as soon as the unit tests pass. meeting

vikram senior dev david, i hear your concern about the validation cliff, i really do. but lets look at the mql trace i ran on their existing production data yesterday. the clients new workflow requires a route base purpose that needs to be dynamically filtered based on the user is organizational unit. if we use the ootb fixedrange attribute, well be hacking the emxroute_mxjpo to forcefeed logic into a schema that simply was not designed for it. david ba but vikram, is not that what the jpo is for? cannot we just use wouldescription or a custom property on the object to avoid a fullblown schema change? vikram senior dev right, let me think. if we use wouldescription to store structured data, we lose the ability to index. when we have 50,000 routes in production, a query for all routes for manufacturing unit x will time out the app server because mql has to do a full table scan. from an architectural standpoint, thats building on sand. anjali dev to build on vikram is point, the 3dspace framework we are using is designed to bind directly to schema attributes. if we start hiding data in json strings within the wouldescription field, id have to write custom parsers for every single field in the ui. wed be trading a onetime schema change for a permanent maintenance nightmare in the javascript layer. priya qe and what about the electronic signatures? under cfr part 11, we need an immutable, timestamped audit trail. if the jpo logic is not perfectly synchronized with the route task lifecycle triggers, we might miss a signature event. vikram, how are you planning to handle the trigger synchronization? vikram senior dev thats exactly why i want the schema extension, priya. i plan to hook into the create and amodify triggers of the route node relationship. if we have dedicated attributes, the system triggers can fire based on discrete data changes. mark senior qe speaking of performance, have you guys looked at the emxnotificationutil integration? if were triggering 3dnotifications for every route task creation, and we have routes with over 500 tasks, the database locktime during the create transaction is going to be massive. david ba 500 tasks? is that a realistic use case for this client? mark senior qe going back to vikram is point on the production data traceyes. their packaging approval routes are massive. if the jpo hangs for 10 seconds every time sarah hits isubmit, the users will revolt. anjali dev could we use a background job for the notifications? vikram senior dev we could, but then we have a timelag. for medical devices, realtime notification is often a requirement for the quality leads. priya qe right, but realtime should not mean systemhang. if the mql query for route nodes is blocked because of a notification lock, we have a bigger problem. sarah po let is pause there. vikram, if we go with the schema extension, how much does it simplify anjali is ui work? anjali dev it makes it about 40 faster. i can use the standard webcomponent binding instead of writing custom react hooks for every legacy webform field. david ba im still worried about the csv team. if i tell them we are adding attribute_auditcategory and attribute_routesecuritylevel, they will want a fivepage justification. vikram senior dev i can give you the mql trace logs to show that ootb performance is insufficient for their volume. that should be enough for the auditors. mark senior qe we should also consider the api load. if the widget is polling for status updates, we need to make sure the mql queries are as lean as possible. anjali dev i can implement a websocket notification in the widget to avoid polling if the 3dspace infrastructure supports it. sarah po right, i think we have a solid technical consensus now. to wrap things up we are moving forward with the schema extensions for emxroute and route node because the performance risk of staying ootb is too high for the clients volume. david, i need you to help vikram document the justification for the csv team we do not hit a wall during validation. this will be an 8point story, which vikram will lead from the pes side while anjali starts the ui implementation. mark and priya, i am expecting the load test scripts and compliance hlts to reflect these new attributes. let is make sure we hit the sprint 1 goals.'] selected_action_items=None\n","[DEBUG] Received query: summarize the 4th event with Mistral\n","[DEBUG] Selected event indices: [3]\n","[DEBUG] Mode: Mistral\n","[DEBUG] Processed transcripts: ['route project kickoff meeting sarah po good morning, everyone. i can see everyone is on the call f...\n","[DEBUG] Determined stage: summarize\n","[DEBUG] Calling orchestrator.handle_query...\n","[A2A] ENTER endpoint: handle_query\n","[DEBUG] OrchestratorAgent.handle_query called with:\n","        stage: summarize\n","        mode: Mistral\n","        create_jira: False\n","        user: None\n","        date: None\n","        permissions: None\n","        selected_event_indices: [3]\n","        processed_transcripts: ['route project kickoff meeting sarah po good morning, everyone. i can see everyone is on the call f...\n","        query: summarize the 4th event with Mistral\n","[DEBUG] Stage: summarize\n","[DEBUG] processed_transcripts arg: ['route project kickoff meeting sarah po good morning, everyone. i can see everyone is on the call f...\n","[DEBUG] transcripts_to_summarize (before): ['route project kickoff meeting sarah po good morning, everyone. i can see everyone is on the call f...\n","[DEBUG] transcripts_to_summarize (after fallback): ['route project kickoff meeting sarah po good morning, everyone. i can see everyone is on the call f...\n","[DEBUG] use_lc: False\n","[A2A] REQUEST to summarize_protocol with payload: {'processed_transcripts': ['route project kickoff meeting sarah po good morning, everyone. i can see...\n","[DEBUG] summarize_protocol received mode arg: Mistral, self.mode: Mistral\n","[SummarizationAgent] summarize_protocol using mode: mistral\n","[SummarizationAgent] Number of chunks: 1\n","[SummarizationAgent] Full transcript length: 5398\n","[SummarizationAgent] Entering Mistral branch\n","[SummarizationAgent] Mistral model loaded.\n","[Mistral] summarize_with_mistral called.

massive. if the jpo hangs for 10 seconds every time sarah hits isubmit, the users will revolt. anjali dev could we use a background job for the notifications? vikram senior dev we could, but then we have a timelag. for medical devices, realtime notification is often a requirement for the quality leads. priya qe right, but realtime should not mean systemhang. if the mql query for route nodes is blocked because of a notification lock, we have a bigger problem. sarah po let is pause there. vikram, if we go with the schema extension, how much does it simplify anjali is ui work? anjali dev it makes it about 40 faster. i can use the standard webcomponent binding instead of writing custom react hooks for every legacy webform field. david ba im still worried about the csv team. if i tell them we are adding attribute_auditcategory and attribute_routesecuritylevel, they will want a fivepage justification. vikram senior dev i can give you the mql trace logs to show that ootb performance is insufficient for their volume. that should be enough for the auditors. mark senior qe we should also consider the api load. if the widget is polling for status updates, we need to make sure the mql queries are as lean as possible. anjali dev i can implement a websocket notification in the widget to avoid polling if the 3dspace infrastructure supports it. sarah po right, i think we have a solid technical consensus now. to wrap things up we are moving forward with the schema extensions for emxroute and route node because the performance risk of staying ootb is too high for the clients volume. david, i need you to help vikram document the justification for the csv team we do not hit a wall during validation. this will be an 8point story, which vikram will lead from the pes side while anjali starts the ui implementation. mark and priya, i am expecting the load test scripts and compliance hlts to reflect these new attributes. let is make sure we hit the sprint 1 goals.\n","\n","---\n","\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"summary\": [\n","    \"Discussed the need for a schema extension for emxroute and route node in Route project\",\n","    \"Concerns raised about
